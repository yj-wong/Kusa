## Kusa
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This mile stone folder contains all the intial brainstorming, plans and sketches for our project.

## Inspiration
There are many daily habits that are detrimental to the environment, such as the use of plastics, the use of disposable products, and the waste of materials and energy. Our goal is to create a solution to recognize those habits and provide a better alternative.

## What it does
An App that recognizes environmentally unfriendly habits

## How we built it
We used React to build a single page web application that integrates with Google Cloud Vision API. We deployed our app on Microsoft Azure as a Web Service

## Challenges we ran into
React framework is an evolving framework and therefore two of our team members who had experience with React still need to adapt the changes.  Two of our team members are new to the web application and had little experience with real-world applications and it took us some time to get everybody on the same page.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We integrated the Google Cloud platform API to our application, specifically the Google Cloud Vision service.
Our web app is running on Azure web services and it is available to everyone.

## What we learned
Training a problem-specific machine learning model(versus a general problem-solving model ) will enhance the ability our of detection program. We did learn a lot about modern machine learning and computer vision technologies and how to apply them in our project. We are also now confident with our web programming skills, especially how to build a project using React.

## What's next for Kusa
User authentication and database are definitely two features that we can add to our existing project. A more advanced and intelligent detection program will also be beneficial for our overall final evaluation. There can also be more user-friendly features that we could implement including the integration with home assistant devices.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the required node modules before launching the app

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
